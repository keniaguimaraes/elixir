Functional Programming

While its roots are in lambda calculus,
functional programming can be fun, easy, and
approachable for everyone!
By focusing on breaking problems down into simple,
side-effect free, functions we can ensure fewer bugs,
better test coverage, while incrementally
building our solutions through the composition of well tested functions.
